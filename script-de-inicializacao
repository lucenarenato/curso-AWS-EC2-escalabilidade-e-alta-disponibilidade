Create script "User data" aws ec2, for install docker and docker-compose in linux with yum

Here is an example of a script that can be used as user data for an AWS EC2 instance running a Linux AMI (with yum package manager) to install Docker and Docker Compose:
#!/bin/bash

# Install Docker
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y docker

# Start the Docker service
sudo service docker start

# Add the current user to the "docker" group
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.28.6/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
